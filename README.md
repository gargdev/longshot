# GPT-based Chat Application

## Backend (Express Server)

### 1. Overview
- Built using Express, a Node.js web application framework.
- Serves as an intermediary between the frontend and the Longshot.ai API.

### 2. Dependencies
- `express`: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- `node-fetch`: Enables fetching data from the Longshot.ai API.
- `cors`: Manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

### 3. Endpoints
- **`/api/chat` (POST):**
  - Accepts user input and sends it to the Longshot.ai API.
  - Retrieves the generated content and adds it to the chat history.
  - Saves the updated chat history to local storage.

- **`/api/title` (POST):**
  - Accepts a title from the frontend.
  - Utilizes Longshot.ai to generate a title based on the provided input.

- **`/api/chat-history` (GET):**
  - Retrieves the chat history from the server.

- **`/api/delete-chat-history` (POST):**
  - Deletes a specific entry from the chat history based on the provided index.
  - Updates the local storage accordingly.

### 4. Local Storage
- The chat history is stored locally to maintain state between server restarts.
- The `loadChatHistoryFromLocalStorage` function loads the chat history on server startup.
- The `saveChatHistoryToLocalStorage` function periodically saves the chat history to local storage.

### 5. Error Handling
- Errors during message processing are logged, and appropriate responses are sent to the frontend.
- HTTP error responses are provided for invalid requests.

### 6. Periodic Saving
- The chat history is saved to local storage every 5 minutes using `setInterval`.

## Frontend (React)

### 1. Overview
- Built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

### 2. Components
- **`Chat` Component:**
  - Manages user input, chat history, and interactions with the backend.
  - Displays chat messages and titles.

### 3. User Interaction
- Users can type messages in the input field and send them to the backend.
- Clicking on examples populates the input field.
- Users can delete entries from the chat history.

### 4. Fetching Data
- `fetchChatHistory` retrieves chat history from the server on component mount.
- Data is fetched from the backend on user input and deletion actions.

### 5. Sending Messages
- User messages are sent to the backend using the `/api/chat` endpoint.
- Generated assistant messages are displayed in the chat.

### 6. Generating Titles
- Titles are generated using the `/api/title` endpoint and added to the chat history.

### 7. Periodic Updates
- The frontend periodically fetches chat history to keep it updated.

## Conclusion

This chat application seamlessly integrates a React frontend with an Express backend, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the Longshot.ai API. The modular structure and use of local storage ensure data persistence and a smooth user experience. Error handling and periodic updates contribute to the application's robustness and reliability.
